# Project Overview

For Project Two, I wanted to explore the concept of Community through the differences we have. To me, an important part of a community is being able to surround yourself with people that accept you for who you are. But in today’s social climate, where social exclusion and stereotypes are still prevalent, it can be difficult to see eye to eye with people of different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. It leads to issues with navigating identity and having a sense of belonging with the environment you’re in. 

With that in mind, the song I decided to animate was “Easier Said Than Done” by Thee Sacred Souls. This song stands out to me as a way of capturing true love and the struggles that come out of it. It supports the concept of community as achieving true love and acceptance by embracing our backgrounds. 


# Technical Overview
To simulate a text conversation between two people, I alternate each lyric between sides, depending on who is speaking. Lines that start with "She said" appear on the left, while lines beginning with "I said" are aligned on the right. The first line on each page fades into view, followed by a second line that appears with a typewriter effect. A blinking cursor moves toward the center, revealing delayed text.
